== Keyboards ==

Keyboard objects (`kbd()`) are much simpler than fonts. There are a number of attributes associated with a keyboard and they are listed here along with their default values:

source::
	The source file is a keyman keyboard source file with extension `.kmn`. (Required)

target::
	The target file is the compiled keyman keyboard and defaults to the source `.kmn` file with kmn replaced as `.kmx`

The following are attributes specific to generating a sample layout of the keyboard:

font::
	Font filename to use for rendering the layout (required).

fontname::
	Public font name that is used by the OS to reference the font.

fontdir::
	Directory containing the font specified in `font`. This defaults to `kbdfonts`.

kbdfont::
	Full pathname to font file to use for rendering the layout. By default this is built from the `font` and `fontdir` attributes.

fontsize::
	Font size to render glyphs at in the layout, given in pt (18).

pdf::
	Filename to put keyboard layout pdf in ('source'.pdf)

svg::
	Intermediate svg format of keyboard layout ('source'.svg)

xml::
	Intermediate xml that represents the basic keystrokes of the keyboard ('source'.xml)

An example specification of a keyboard object might be:

----
kbd(source = 'mykbd.kmn',
	fontname = 'My Font',
	font = 'results/myfont.ttf')
----


=== Tests ===

There are currently no automated tests for keyboards, although the generation of the layout can be considered a test.
