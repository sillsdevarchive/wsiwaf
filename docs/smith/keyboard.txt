== Keyboards ==

Keyboard objects (`kbd()`) are much simpler than fonts. There are a number of attributes associated with a keyboard and they are listed here along with their default values:

source::
	The source file is a Keyman keyboard source file with extension `.kmn`. (Required)

target::
	The target file is the compiled Keyman keyboard and defaults to the source `.kmn` file with kmn replaced as `.kmx`

The following are attributes specific to generating a sample layout of the keyboard:

font::
	Font filename to use for rendering the layout (required).

fontname::
	Public font name that is used by the OS to reference the font.

fontdir::
	Directory containing the font specified in `font`. This defaults to `kbdfonts`.

kbdfont::
	Full pathname to font file to use for rendering the layout. By default this is built from the `font` and `fontdir` attributes.

fontsize::
	Font size to render glyphs at in the layout, given in pt (18).

pdf::
	Filename to put keyboard layout pdf in ('source'.pdf)

svg::
	Intermediate svg format of keyboard layout ('source'.svg)

xml::
	Intermediate xml that represents the basic keystrokes of the keyboard ('source'.xml)

mskbd::
	An object that describes how to create an MS keyboard from the .kmn file.

An example specification of a keyboard object might be:

----
kbd(source = 'mykbd.kmn',
	fontname = 'My Font',
	font = 'results/myfont.ttf')
----

=== mskbd ===

The mskbd object can be used for the mskbd parameter of a keyboard. It automatically generates
a normal MS Keyboard from the .kmn file and compiles it. The dependencies are pretty stiff, but
it does mean that a complete MS solution can be generated without needing to run special GUI
software during the development cycle. The parameters to mskbd() are:

lid::
	Language LCID to store this keyboard under. If not specified, defaults to 0xC00.

guid::
	GUID to associate with the keyboard. If not specified a random one is created.

The following are internal attributes that may be set:

arches::
	List of architectures that may be built for. Currently i586 and amd64. This is unlikely to be set by a user.

source::
	.kmn source file, defaults to keyboard .source attribute

c_file::
	.c file to generate (same as source but with .c extension)

rc_file::
	.rc file to generate (same as source but with .rc extension)

o_file::
	.o file to generate from .c file (same as source but with .o extension)

dll::
	.dll file to create (same as source but with .dll extension)

=== Tests ===

There are currently no automated tests for keyboards, although the generation of the layout can be considered a test.
